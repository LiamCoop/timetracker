## Installation (WIP)

In order to run this locally you'll need to spin up a new database, and run the migrations against it.
You'll also need to add the appropriate authentication secrets to a .env file, see .env.example.

Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies.
`cd client`
`npm i`
